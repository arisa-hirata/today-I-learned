# Singly Linked List

## What is a linked list?
A data structure that contains a __head__, __tail__ and __length__ property.  
Linked Lists consist of nodes, and each __node__ has a __value__ and a __pointer__ to another node or null

## Comparisos with Arrays
#### Lists
- Do not have indexes!
- Connected via nodes with a __next__ pointer
- Random access is not allowed

#### Arrays
- Indexed in order!
- Insertion and deletion can be expensive
- Can quickly be accessed at a specific index

## Big O of Singly Linked List
Insertion -   __O(1)__
Removal -   __It depends.... O(1) or O(N)__
Searching -   __O(N)__
Access -   __O(N)__

## RECAP
- Singly Linked Lists are an excellent alternative to arrays when insertion and deletion at the beginning are frequently required
- Arrays contain a built in index whereas Linked Lists - do not
- The idea of a list data structure that consists of nodes is the foundation for other data structures like Stacks and Queues
