# Singly Linked List

## What is a linked list?
A data structure that contains a __head__, __tail__ and __length__ property.  
Linked Lists consist of nodes, and each __node__ has a __value__ and a __pointer__ to another node or null

## Comparisos with Arrays
#### Lists
- Do not have indexes!
- Connected via nodes with a __next__ pointer
- Random access is not allowed

#### Arrays
- Indexed in order!
- Insertion and deletion can be expensive
- Can quickly be accessed at a specific index
