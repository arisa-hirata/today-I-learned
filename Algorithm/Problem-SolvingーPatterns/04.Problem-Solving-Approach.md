# WHAT IS AN ALGORITHM?

- A **process** or **set of steps** to accomplish a certain task.

## HOW DO YOU IMPROVE?

1. **Devise** a plan for solving problems.
2. **Master** common problem solving patterns.

## PROBLEM SOLVING

- Understan the Problem
- Explore Concreate Examples
- Break It Down
- Solve/Simply
- Look Back and Refactor

## UNDERSTAN THE PROBLEM

1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?
3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the prolem?
4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem? (You may not be able to answer this question until you set about solving the problem. That's okay; it's still worth considering the question at this early stage.)
5. How should I label the important pieces of data that are q part of the problem?

```javascript
function charCount(str) {
  // make object to return at end
    var result = {};
    // loop over string, for earch character...
    for(var i = ; i < str.length; i++){
        var char = str[i].toLowerCase()
        // if the char is a number/letter AND is a key in object, add one to count
        if(result[char] > 0) {
            result[char]++;
        }
        // if the char is a number/letter AND not in object, add it to object and set value to 1
        else {
            result[char] = 1;
        };
    }
    // if character is something else (space, period, etc.) don't do anything
    //  return object at end
    return result;
}

```

â‡© REFACTOR

```javascript
function charCount(str) {
    var obj = {};
    for (var char of str) {
        char = char.toLowerCase();
        obj[char] = obj[char] || 1;
    }
    return obj;
}

fucntion isAlphaNumeric(char) {
    var code = char.charCodeAt(0);
    if (!(code > 47 && code < 58) && // numeric (0-9)
        !(code > 64 && code < 91) && // upper alpha (A-Z)
        !(code > 96 && code < 123)) {// lower alpha (a-z)
        return false;
    }
    return;
}

```

```
charCount("Hello WORLD hi!!");

```
