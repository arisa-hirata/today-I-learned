# Types

### Types

Easy way to refer to the different properties + functions that a value has.

### Why do we care about types?

- Types are used by the TypeScript Compiler to analyze our code for errors.
- Types allow other engineers to understand what values are flowing around our codebase.

### WHere do we use types?

- Everywhere!

### Type Annotations and Inference

**Type Annotations**

- Code we add to tell TypeScript what type of value a variable will refer to
  **Type Inference**
- TypeScript tries to figure out what types of value a variable referes to
