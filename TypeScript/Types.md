# Types

## Types

Easy way to refer to the different properties + functions that a value has.

## Why do we care about types?

- Types are used by the TypeScript Compiler to analyze our code for errors.
- Types allow other engineers to understand what values are flowing around our codebase.

## Where do we use types?

- Everywhere!

## Type Annotations and Inference

#### Type Annotations
- Code we add to tell TypeScript what type of value a variable will refer to

#### Type Inference
- TypeScript tries to figure out what types of value a variable referes to
